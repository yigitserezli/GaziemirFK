This MVC project is the first one I designed and coded to meet real needs. 
The project allows sports club coaches to perform CRUD operations and parents to send bulk emails to the age groups their children are involved in. 
Parents will be able to monitor their children's status and also follow their schedules. 
Cookie Authentication is used, and activation processes can be done with the Gmail service.
